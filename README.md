# Bernstein and usual methods to find polynomial real roots 

This is a math project given by M.Garnier for my 3rd year at the engineering school ESIREM

The objective was to solve polynomial from 2nd to 5th grade using usual methods and a Bernstein method, so we could compare the two of them.

The information to compile are in the folder "src" (trick : use the command 'make')

The authors of this project are WYDER Sevrin and ANQUETIN Romain (https://github.com/Mortpo *big thanks to him*).
